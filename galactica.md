>>> "In summary, Galactica is able to " <<< 

In summary, Galactica is able to (i) produce a large variety of galaxy types
by varying the model parameters; (ii) produce galaxies with a variety
of morphologies; (iii) reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function
(LF); (iv) produce a wide range of color gradients in the galaxies, and
(v) reproduce the observed galaxy size distribution.

# 3.2. The color-magnitude relation

Figure 4.— Color-magnitude diagram of simulated galaxies.
Galaxies are color coded according to their morphological type.
The symbols and lines show the same as in Figure 1.

Figure 4 shows the color-magnitude diagram of the simulated
galaxies. The symbols and lines show the same as in Figure1. As in the observational data, the color-magnitude
relation of the simulated galaxies shows a bimodal distribution. The
red sequence consists of early-type galaxies, and the blue sequence
consists of late-type galaxies. The early-type galaxies are brighter
than \(M_{r}=-20.5\), and their color-magnitude relation is well
described by a straight line. The slope of the color-magnitude relation
of the early-type galaxies is \(\sim 0.2\) mag/mag, which is slightly
steeper than the observed slope. The color-magnitude relation of the
late-type galaxies shows a wide range of colors and a large scatter.
The red sequence of the late-type galaxies has a similar slope as the
early-type galaxies, but it is offset from the early-type sequence by\(\sim 0.5\) mag.

Figure 5.— Color gradients of the simulated galaxies.
The symbols and lines show the same
as in Figure 1.

Figure 5 shows the color gradients of the simulated galaxies.
The symbols show the same as in Figure 1. The color gradients
of the simulated galaxies are in the range \(-0.1\) to \(0.7\) mag/dex.
The color gradients of the early-type galaxies show a large scatter,
and are not well described by a straight line. The color gradients of
the late-type galaxies show a large scatter as well. The color gradients
of the late-type galaxies are not correlated with their colors.

# 3.3. The size-magnitude relation

Figure 6.— Size-magnitude diagram of simulated galaxies.
The symbols and lines show
the same as in Figure 1.

The size-magnitude relation of the simulated galaxies is shown in Figure6. The symbols show the same as in Figure 1,
and the lines show the same as in Figure 2. The size-magnitude
relation of the simulated galaxies shows the same behavior as the
observational data. The size-magnitude relation of the early-type
galaxies shows a wide range of sizes, and the size-magnitude relation
of the late-type galaxies is well described by a straight line. The
slope of the size-magnitude relation of the early-type galaxies is\(\sim 0.4\) dex/mag, which is slightly steeper than the observed slope.

Figure 7.— Size-color diagram of simulated galaxies.
The symbols and line show the same as in
Figure 2.

The size-color relation of the simulated galaxies is shown in Figure7. The symbols show the same as in Figure2, and the line shows the same as in Figure3. The size-color relation of the simulated galaxies is
similar to the observed one. The size-color relation of the early-type
galaxies shows an increasing trend of the size with the color, and the
size-color relation of the late-type galaxies shows a large scatter.

# 4. Discussion

In this section, we compare our results with the results of previous
studies. We also discuss the limitations of our study, and the
implications of our results for the galaxy formation.

# 4.1. Comparison with previous studies

The galaxy formation model used in this study was originally
developed by Kauffmann et al. (). The model was later updated by
Governato et al. (2005, 2007, 2009) and Guo et al. (). We compare
the results of the present study with the results of these previous
studies.

Kauffmann et al. () studied the dependence of the galaxy color on the
environment. They used a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,
and showed that the fraction of blue galaxies depends on the environment,
and is higher in high density regions. They also showed that the
color-magnitude relation of galaxies is well described by a straight
line. They found that the color of galaxies depends on their
environment, but they did not show the dependence of the color on the
environment in the color-magnitude diagram.

Governato et al. 2005, 2009 studied the dependence of the galaxy
morphology on the environment. They used a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation, and showed that the fraction of elliptical galaxies
depends on the environment, and is higher in high density regions. They
also showed that the size-magnitude relation of the galaxies is well
described by a straight line. They showed that the morphology of the
galaxies depends on their environment, but they did not show the
dependence of the morphology on the environment in the size-magnitude
diagram.

Guo et al. () studied the dependence on the environment of the
galaxy color, morphology, and color gradients. They used a semi-analytic
model of galaxy formation, and showed that the fraction of blue galaxies
depends on the environment, and is larger in high density regions. They
also showed the color-magnitude relation of the galaxies is well
represented by a straight line. They showed that the color of the
galaxies depends on their environment, and the color-magnitude relation
of the galaxies depends on the environment. They found that the
fraction of elliptical galaxies depends on the environment, and is
larger in high density regions. They also showed that a large fraction
of elliptical galaxies have red cores, and the color gradients of the
galaxies are correlated with their colors. They showed that the
morphology of the galaxies depends on their environment, and the
size-magnitude relation of the galaxies depends on the environment.

In the present study, we study the dependence on the environment of the
galaxy morphology, color, color gradients, and size. We use a different
galaxy formation model, and we find that the results are consistent with
the results of the previous studies.

# 4.2. Limitations of the study

In the present study, we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation, and study the dependence on the environment of the galaxy
morphology, color, color gradients, and size. The semi-analytic model
is an efficient tool for studying galaxy formation. The semi-analytic
model assumes that galaxies form by a set of physical processes such as
gas cooling, star formation, feedback, mergers, etc. The semi-analytic
model also assumes that galaxies evolve in a static dark matter halo
potential, and that the dark matter halo is the only gravitational
potential in the universe. The semi-analytic model is able to
self-consistently predict the galaxy properties such as the stellar
mass, color, morphology, and star formation rate. The semi-analytic
model has been used to study galaxy formation in different environments
(e.g. Kauffmann et al. ; Croton et al. ; De Lucia et al. ; Guo et al. ; Guo & White ; Guo et al. ).

The semi-analytic model has several limitations. The semi-analytic
model assumes that dark matter halos are static. The dark matter
halos can grow by accretion of surrounding dark matter halos, and
they can merge with each other. The semi-analytic model also assumes
that the dark matter halos have a spherical shape. The dark matter
halos can have a triaxial shape, and the shape of the dark matter halo
depends on the mass of the dark matter halo. The semi-analytic model
also assumes that the dark matter halo is the only gravitational potential
in the universe. The semi-analytic model does not take into account
the effect of the large scale structure. The semi-analytic model also
does not take into account the effect of the galaxy-galaxy interactions
such as mergers.

The semi-analytic model assumes that galaxies form by a set of physical
processes such as gas cooling, star formation, feedback, mergers,
etc. The semi-analytic model also assumes that galaxies evolve in a
static dark matter halo potential, and that the dark matter halo is the
only gravitational potential in the universe. The semi-analytic model
is able to self-consistently predict the galaxy properties such as the
stellar mass, color, morphology, and star formation rate, and is able
to study the galaxy formation in different environments.

# 4.3. Implications of the results

In the present study, we use the semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation, to study the dependence on the environment of the galaxy’s
morphology, color, color gradients
